# Titanic_Survival_prediction
This project is a Machine Learning implementation of the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset. The goal is to build predictive models that determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and family relationships.
